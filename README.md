# Giga Ciacho – UML System Analysis

A student project developed as part of a **Computer Science degree**, for the **Software Engineering** course.  
It presents the concept of an IT system designed for a **fictional bakery called "Giga Ciacho"**,  
prepared as part of a coursework assignment.

## About the Project

The aim of the project was to analyze the business processes of a small bakery and propose an **Inventory Control (IC)** system
